{"name":"Sirious","body":"# Sirious, the _totally sirious_ Siri Proxy.\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nSirious is a tampering proxy server for Apple's Siri Assistant, allowing you to extend Siri to add custom commands/functionality.\r\n\r\n_Sirious does **not** allow you to run Siri on an unauthorised (non-iPhone4S) device_\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nNot really, but feel free to drop by #sirious on freenode.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Plugins\r\n\r\nThe Plugin API should be pretty stable now, until I discover more stuff in the Siri Protocol we can abuse. Take a look at sirious.plugins.sirious_test for a pretty clear example\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation/Usage\r\n\r\nInstall using the usual method:\r\n\r\n    $ python setup install.py\r\n\r\nThen you will need to run `sirious-gencerts` to generate your certificates for you. The location of these will be automatically calculated based on how you run/install Sirious.\r\nIt will be either:\r\n\r\n    ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/.sirious/\r\n    ~/.sirious/\r\n\r\nInside an `ssl` subdir.\r\nIf you wish to load plugins, or pass any configuration options, your config file should by `sirious.cfg` in the above directory. A sample config is provided with the package.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, you can run sirious simply by typing its name!\r\n\r\n    $ sirious\r\n\r\nYou will now need to \"poison\" your DNS to point `guzzoni.apple.com` at your Sirious server. This is outside the scope of this readme, but I suggest dnsmasq.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, navigate to https://guzzoni.apple.com on your iPhone, if the DNS changes were sucessful you should be offered the CA Certificate generated earlier. Accept/install this certificate and you can start using Siri via Sirious!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\n* Applidium, without who I wouldn't have really known where to start with the Siri Protocol\r\n* plamoni/SiriProxy, sometimes it's nice to have a reference even in a language you don't speak :)\r\n* chendo, for some (albeit Rubyist) Plugin API inspiration\r\n","tagline":"Tampering Siri Proxy","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
